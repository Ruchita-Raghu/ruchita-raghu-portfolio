# GLOBAL AND INTER-CULTURAL EXPERIENCES
#### SUMMARY
<p> The specialty about India is that every state has its own culture, language, food, customs etc. My parents are from different states and worked in a city different than their hometowns. Because of that, with ease and joy, I embrace the cultures of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and New Delhi. Understanding the multi-cultural world comes easily to me. I highly encourage the value that diversity and inclusivity bring to a person. </p>
<p> Specialities! - 
 <li> Speak 4 languages - English, Hindi, Kannada, Tamil </li>
 <li> Cultural adaptation - multiple dances, songs, food! </li> </p>

<p> Here are some experiences that have informed me more about the world and its diversity! </p>
