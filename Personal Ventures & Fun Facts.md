# GLOBAL/INTER-CULTURAL EXPERIENCES & COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT
#### SUMMARY
<p> The specialty about India is that every state has its own culture, language, food, customs etc. My parents are from different states and worked in a city different than their hometowns. Because of that, with ease and joy, I embrace the cultures of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and New Delhi. Understanding the multi-cultural world comes easily to me. I highly encourage the value that diversity and inclusivity bring to a person. </p>
<p> Specialities! - 
 <li> Speak 4 languages - English, Hindi, Kannada, Tamil </li>
 <li> Cultural adaptation - multiple dances, songs, food! </li> </p>

<p> My up-bringing and taught family values encourage me to be an involved member in the community. A community to me means the various different people and groups of people I meet on a daily basis. In this sense, there are several communities I am a part of. They could be my family, friends, neighbors, classmates, co-workers, peers, mentors, students etc. I interact with each community differently since my relation with them is different. </p>
<p> Regardless of who is in front of me, I try to be the best version of myself for them </p>
<li> If they are my family, I attempt to help them in chores, give support, stay together and more. </li>
<li> If they are my students, I need to prepare the best lecture and provide all the necessary knowledge and information. </li>
<li> If they are acquaintances, I should be kind and gentle, and greet them. </li>
<li> Even if I see someone on the bus daily, they form part of my community! </li>
<br>
<p> Here's my international travel experience so far! </p>

### TUTORING YOUNG KIDS
<p> Hindi is one of the languages I speak, perhaps the official language of India. I was offered to tutor children, ages 5 and 7, in this language. Their parents are Indian and they wanted their children to be familiar with their mother tongue. </p>
<li> The tutoring sessions were over Zoom! </li>
<li> The children were not familiar with the language at all </li>
<li> Prepared easy, basic language content over Google docs </li>
<li> Catered to "young" and new learning styles - prepared games, offered simple exercises, prepared fun learning quizzes, showed video clips introducing Indian culture, watched Hindi movies on Zoom etc. </li>
<li> Made the language relevant for the children to use with family and friends </li>
