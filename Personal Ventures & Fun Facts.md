# GLOBAL/INTER-CULTURAL EXPERIENCES & COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT
#### SUMMARY
<p> The specialty about India is that every state has its own culture, language, food, customs etc. My parents are from different states and worked in a city different than their hometowns. Because of that, with ease and joy, I embrace the cultures of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and New Delhi. Understanding the multi-cultural world comes easily to me. I highly encourage the value that diversity and inclusivity bring to a person. </p>
<p> Specialities! - 
 <li> Speak 4 languages - English, Hindi, Kannada, Tamil </li>
 <li> Cultural adaptation - multiple dances, songs, food! </li> </p>

<p> My up-bringing and taught family values encourage me to be an involved member in the community. A community to me means the various different people and groups of people I meet on a daily basis. In this sense, there are several communities I am a part of. They could be my family, friends, neighbors, classmates, co-workers, peers, mentors, students etc. I interact with each community differently since my relation with them is different. </p>
<p> Regardless of who is in front of me, I try to be the best version of myself for them </p>
<li> If they are my family, I attempt to help them in chores, give support, stay together and more. </li>
<li> If they are my students, I need to prepare the best lecture and provide all the necessary knowledge and information. </li>
<li> If they are just acquaintances, I should be kind and gentle, and greet them. </li>
<li> Even if I see someone on the bus daily, they form part of my community! </li>

<p> Here are some experiences that have informed me more about the world, its diversity, and how I get involved with several communities around! </p>

#### DANCE
<p> Bharatnatyam is an Indian Classical Dance Form. A highly technical and intensive training is required for a student to excel in this art form. I have been learning this dance form since the age of 5. I have continued my training under different teachers. I have completed my graduation in this dance form as well. </p>
<p> Dance has changed the way I live life and who I am as a person. Lessons from dance - </p>
<li> Discipline </li>
<li> Hard Work </li>
<li> Multitasking </li>
<li> Importance of health & fitness </li>
<li> Dedication </li>
<li> Focus </li>
<li> Self-motivation and more! </li>
