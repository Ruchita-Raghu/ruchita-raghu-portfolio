# COMPREHENSIVE UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM AND STUDENT DEVELOPMENT
<p> Find below a compilation of classwork from college. The diverse and comprehensive coursework enhanced several skills for me. It has improved my critical thinking, problem solving, creative thinking, communication, and teamwork. </p>

## PART 1 - ANALYTICS
<p> The Business Information & Analytics department at the Daniels College of Business has formed a strong and rigorous undergraduate program. It exposed students to exxtensive coding work. The best part was that the focus was not the programming language and its syntax. The aim was to make us better decision makers, learn how to work with data, what data in front us means, and learn application of technical skills across sectors in business. </p>

#### Python
Basic usage of Python and exploring its use for formatting and statistical purposes.
<li> Code that I learned included 'for' and 'while' loops, if-else-if statements, creating charts and visuals, data validation, XLWings, lists, pandas dataframes, seaborn visuals, regressions and hypothesis tests, pivot tables, text mining tools like vectorization, and multiple optimization models. </li>
<li> Applications involved putting code in the business and decision making context. Such as optimization models were created to solve transportation issues, production quantities, financial decisions etc. When used for statistical tests like regression and hypothesis, the code helped produce output that helps understand relationships between variables in our data. The visualization codes were ideal for creating reports that can be submitted to and reported to a layman but also senior executives. </li>
<br>

#### VBA
Visual Basic was used for us to understand how to code within Excel. I was introduced to the basics of the syntax.
<li> Features used included how to select a cell, place formulas, edit the way macros are run in Excel etc. </li>
<li> Application work included performing summary statistics to automatically update with changing data. The biggest project was to create a loan schedule/mortgage schedule through VBA. Created efficient methods through VBA code to "pivot" the schedule and observe changes in the payment depending on what the principal and interest rate are. </li>
<br>

#### R
The use of R was for a financial modelling class. 
<li> Packages that were used in the class are data.table, tseries, fPortfolio, PortfolioAnalytics, PerformanceAnalytics, xts etc. </li>
<li> In addition to learning the language and its syntax, I explored different applications of R for portfolio optimization and analyzing stocks. </li>
<li> Deriving historical stock data from Yahoo Finance, extracting close prices, calculating monthly/weekly/daily returns, plotting graphs, setting specifications for portfolios, setting constraints for portfolio like long or short position, deriving weight of each stock invested, working target risk and return, deriving the optimal portfolio details and the efficient frontier set were some of the applications. </li>
