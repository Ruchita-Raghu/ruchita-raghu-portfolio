<h2> Lessons from work </h2>
<p> My biggest lesson from all work experiences has been an effort to learn. No matter the rank or role, learning should never stop. I found it highly important and useful to take notes regarding everything I do. It starts with learning about the company through internal sites, meeting minutes, informational interviews and networking, and self-educating activities. </p>
<li> One of my companies followed EOS, Entrepreneurial Operating System, a people operating system not computer operating system. Just to understand the system, its benefits, and how the company worked with it, I created a notes sheet. </li>
<li> Learning platforms at organizations are really beneficial for our professional skills development. During internships, I completed courses and obtained certifications relating to my work.</li>
<li> Notes during networking are vital to value someone's time and advice. One of the companies I was wanting to join had a virtual networking event. I made use of the event to best understand the organization and its people. Here is how I encourage everyone to keep the networking effort going. </li>
