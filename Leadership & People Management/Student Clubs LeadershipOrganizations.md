# CLUB LEADERSHIP
#### SUMMARY
<p> Undergraduate student clubs provide several opportunities to make friends, network, learn, explore etc. The most important and crucial opportunity being leadership. I joined two executive boards for student organizations - Undergraduate Women in Business and Finance Club. 
  Both helped me develop as a person and as a professional. </p>
<li> Freshman Year - Internation Student Affairs Chair - Finance Club </li>
<li> Sophomore Year- Events Chair - Finance Club
<li> Sophomore Year - Director of Diversity - Women in Business </li> 
<li> Junior Year - President - Finance Club </li>

#### RESPONSIBILITIES & LEADING PEOPLE
<p> The Finance Club was mostly forgotten about during the pandemic since we were completely remote. When I started as President in June 2021, the campus was back in person. </p>
<p> My aim - To get the club back on its feet. More engagement and scale. New people. New ideas. Continued and sustainable event schedules. </p>
<br>
<p> Lessons on the job - </p>
<li> Be forward looking. What Next? Where are we headed? </li>
<li> Long-term strategy is important. Easy to get absorbed in the day-to-day event details. Don't forget the ultimate agenda of the organization </li>
<li> Plan events with backup plans. Be aware that things can go south at any time. </li>
<li> People management is difficult. </li>
<p> Managing different schedules of college students is an important skill. Also, the other board members were all new. They didn't know anything about the processes, our connections, our events, our working style etc. It was my job to make them aware of the big picture, teach them their role, prepare them for the work, and provide them the resources to do so. </p>
<li> Exhibit good character, build trust, provide support. </li>
<p> A lot of my focus was to ensure the executive board and the club members felt comfortable. When someone is going through a hard time, I have to give them space and find coverage for their work </p>
<li> Create accountability and ownership of work among the team members. It is crucial to build a commitment among the team members for the club. </li>

#### MANAGEMENT & PLANNING
<p> In addition to the day-to-day activities of the Finance Club, I worked to enhance the functioning of the club going forward. </p>
<li> Created new executive board list - create roles and define responsibilities. To recruit young talent with fresh ideas! </li>
<li> Created a Teams group - divide channels, organize folders, upload files, store data in one repository. </li>
<li> Visualized events for whole team - created calendar for the academic year. </li>
<li> Provide templates and samples from previous years - Sample event protocol, how to write emails to finance professors, how to form invites, where to find data and so on. </li>
