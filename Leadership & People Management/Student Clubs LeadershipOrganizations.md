# CLUB LEADERSHIP
#### SUMMARY
<p> Undergraduate student clubs provide several opportunities together such as making friends, networking, learning, exploring etc. The most important and crucial opportunity is leadership. During my time at DU, I joined two student organizations - Undergraduate Women in Business and Finance Club. Both helped me develop as a person and as a professional. </p>
<p> I served as the Director of Diversity for Undergraduate Women in Business during my second year.
With the Finance Club, I started as the International Student Affairs Chair my first year, became Events Chair in the next year, and transitioned to President during my third year. I was the youngest student for the position and also the only woman on the executive board that year. This experience has taught me a lot about how to be a leader. </p>

#### RESPONSIBILITIES & LEADING PEOPLE
<p> The club was mostly forgotten about during the 2020-2021 academic year since we were completely remote. When I started my role as President in June 2021, my aim was to get the club back on its feet. I wanted more engagement and scale.</p>
<p> Here are some things I learned - </p>
<li> A leader has to be forward looking. What Next? Where are we headed? </li>
<li> A long-term strategy is important. It is easy to get absorbed in the day-to-day event planning that one forgets the ultimate agenda of the organization. </li>
<li> Planning an event step-by-step is great but always prepare backup plans. Be aware that things can go south at any time. </li>
<li> People management is difficult. The executive board members with me were all new to the club. They didn't know anything about the processes, our connections, our events, our working style etc. It was my job to make them aware of the big picture, teach them their role, prepare them for the work, and provide them the resources to do so. </li>
<li> A leader needs to exhibit a great character. A lot of my focus was to ensure the executive board and the club members felt comfortable. When someone is going through a hard time, I have to give them space and find coverage for their work </li>
<li> Leaders are responsible for creating accountability and ownership of work among the team members. Managing different schedules of college students is also another important skill. It is crucial to build a commitment among the team members for the club. </li>

#### MANAGEMENT & PLANNING
<p> In addition to the day-to-day activities of the club, I worked to enhance the functioning of the club. </p>
<li> Created new executive board list - create roles and define responsibilities. To recruit young talent with fresh ideas! </li>
<li> Created a Teams group - divide channels, organize folders, upload files, store data in one repository. </li>
<li> Visualized events for whole team - created calendar for the academic year. </li>
<li> Provide templates and samples from previous years - Sample event protocol, how to write emails to finance professors, how to form invites, where to find data and so on. </li>
