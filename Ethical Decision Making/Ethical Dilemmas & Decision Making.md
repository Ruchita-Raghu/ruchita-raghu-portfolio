# ETHICAL DECISION MAKING

### IMPORTANCE OF ETHICS
<p> Ethics to me means a personal value and virtue that I carry with me in my everyday life. </p>
<p> Bill Daniels, after whom our business college, Daniels College of Business was named, emphasized the importance of ethics in our lives. Our curriculum reiterates ethics in almost every class. Each professor tells us what happens in the real world versus what should happen. We are taught how to approach difficult decisions in the industry. </p>
<p> Coursework in ethics - Business Ethics & Legal Studies </p>
<li> Understanding of ethical frameworks - Utilitarian Approach, Rights Approach etc. </li>
<li> Introduction to Deontology </li>
<li> Virtue Ethics and the Spectrum </li>
<li> Challenges to overcome and how to make more ethcial decisions </li>

### ETHICAL DILEMMAS
<i> Examples of ethical dilemmas I faced - </i>
<li> Classes - Peers ask to show answers or copy my work when it may not be allowed. Learning how to maintain academic integrity and be firm in doing the right thing. </li>
<li> Microsoft Teaching - Managing class environment and meeting students with different backgrounds. Get rid of presumptions and biases about people. Make classes more inclusive. </li>
<li> Jobs and internships - Be willing to do extra work as intern. Ask questions politely. Being honest when you don't know something. </li>
<li> Competitions and projects - Maintain healthy competitiveness. Allow others to succeed with you. Promote win-win situations wherever possible. </li>
