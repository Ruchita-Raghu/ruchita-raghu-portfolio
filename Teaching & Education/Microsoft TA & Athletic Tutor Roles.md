# TEACHING EXPERIENCES

##### SUMMARY
As a Microsoft TA, I was responsible for teaching 3 to 4 classes with about 30 students each in an academic term. Our Microsoft Certification program is designed to train first-year undergraduate students in basic uses of Excel, Word, PowerPoint, and Advanced Excel. My role encompassed instructing and lecturing in class - familiarize students with the tools, why applications behave in a certain way, which formulas to use, real world applicability etc. I also helped grade student assignments, proctor certification exams, and mentor other TAs in training.
This role developed my public speaking, communication, inter-personal, people management, critical thinking, and problem solving skills.

As an Athletic Tutor, I was given several classes to tutor for. A challenging role since many students request tutoring for tough classes, the ones in which I may not be good either. For exmaple, concepts in multinational finance including foreign exchange, hedging, options, pricing, and currency swaps are tougb to teach. These topics are not my strength so, I had to put several hours of preparation.
This role developed my critical thinking skills as I came up with multiple methods of explanations. I had to learn to be available, flexible, understanding, and patient.

##### METHODS OF TEACHING
<i> Tutoring Practices & Challenges </i>
<li> Explaining concepts - Be extremely careful and not give away answers for assignments </li>
<li> Inability to explain, read from program notes or access online resources </li>
<li> Extensive prep time - refer past notes, homework answers, train for possible hypothetical doubts, online resources before tutoring session </li>
<li> Devise easy ways of understanding concepts - create flowcharts, draw diagrams, write formulas, solve calculations on paper, visualize using Excel </li>
<li> Ensure student understood concepts and did not just "get the answer" </li>
<br>
<i> Here are some methodologies I devised to explain formulas to beginners in Excel - </i>

<br>
<i> Analogies and applications of Microsoft tools - </i>
<li> Using Excel for data analysis. Data could be about sales, HR, audits, marketing research, stocks, and expenses </li>
<li> PowerPoint presentations are linked to results on Excel sheets. You can link both for charts to automatically update in the presentation </li>
<li> Vlookup has some limitations, use the alternatives like INDEX/MATCH </li>
<li> Build a good resume by using appropriate formatting, indentation, text styles, and lists in Word. Taught students to use bibliography and citations tools in Word for academic papers </li>
<br>
<br>
<i> Problem solving and troubleshooting - </i>
<pre> <p> <b> Student Question: </b> My formula is showing an error! </p>
  <b> TA Answers: </b> Does your formula look the same as mine?
                Did you reference the cells correctly?
                Let's have a look at your data set/table to see missing/incorrect data.
                Let's try another formula.
                Let's Google the issue. </pre>
<pre> <p> <b> Student Question: </b> My numbers are all left aligned. How do I fix that? </p>
  <b> TA Answers: </b> Did you use the correct formula?
                Make sure you've not written anything inside double-quotes.
                Try the number format on the Home Tab.
                Try using Text to Columns on the Data Tab.
                Let's try another formula.
                Let's Google the issue. </pre>

<br>
<i> People Management - </i>
<li> Role similar to teacher/professor. Maintain student engagement in class, answer difficult questions, manage student emails (especially during pandemic with increased protocols), and provide additional support to students in need  </li>
<li> Communicate with people from various different backgrounds. Cater to multiple learning styles in one class </li>
<li> Tutoring for different subject material, be a multi-tasker. Importance of subject area knowledge and ability to juggle multiple projects with multiple clients surrounding multiple issues </li>

##### REVISION METHODS
As part of maintaining class engagement and providing "fun" ways of refreshing previous class material, I created online games for students. Questions were geared towards course content but provided a new way to learn.
