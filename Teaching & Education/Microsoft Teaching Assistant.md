# TEACHING EXPERIENCES
#### Microsoft Office Specialist Team, Daniels College of Business, University of Denver
#### Microsoft Senior & Junior Teaching Assistant, September 2020 - June 2023

##### EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
As a Microsoft TA at my university, I was responsible for teaching class sizes of about 30-40 students. Our Microsoft Certification program was deisgned to train first-year undergraduate students in basic uses of Excel, Word, PowerPoint, and Advanced Excel. My role encompassed instructing and lecturing in class - familiarize students with the tools, why applications behave a certain way, which formulas to use, where in the real world are they applied etc. I also helped grade student assignments, proctor certification exams, and mentor TAs in training.

This role developed my public speaking, communication, inter-personal, people management, critical thinking, and problem solving skills.

##### METHODS OF TEACHING
<i> Here are some methodologies I devised to explain formulas to beginners in Excel - </i>

<i> Analogies and applications of Excel formulas - </i>

<i> Problem solving and troubleshooting - </i>
<pre> <p> <b> Student Question: </b> My formula is showing an error! </p>
  <b> TA Answers: </b> Does your formula look the same as mine?
                Did you reference the cells correctly?
                Let's have a look at your data set/table to see missing/incorrect data.
                Let's try another formula.
                Let's Google the issue. </pre>
<pre> <p> <b> Student Question: </b> My numbers are all left aligned. How do I fix that? </p>
  <b> TA Answers: </b> Did you use the correct formula?
                Make sure you've not written anything inside double-quotes.
                Try the number format on the Home Tab.
                Try using Text to Columns on the Data Tab.
                Let's try another formula.
                Let's Google the issue. </pre>

<i> People Management - </i>
<div> A role similar to that of a teacher or professor. I had to maintain student engagement in class, answer difficult questions, manage student emails (especially during the pandemic with increased protocols), provide additional support to students in need etc. </div>
<div> I learned how to communicate with people coming from various different backgrounds. My work taught me how to cater to multiple learning styles in one class. </div>

##### REVISION METHODS
As part of maintaining class engagement and provide "fun" ways of refreshing previous class material, I created online games for students. Questions were geared towards course content but provided a new way to learn.
